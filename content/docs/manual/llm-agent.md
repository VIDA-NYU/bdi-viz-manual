## LLM Validation Panel ü§ñ

![agent-panel](./images/agent-panel.png)

The LLM Validation Panel offers real-time, context-aware suggestions and explanations for each match candidate:

- **Diagnosis Summary**: Evaluates if a match is likely valid based on metadata, column names, and user history.
- **Explanation Cards**: Highlights key reasons for each suggestion (e.g., name similarity, value overlap).
  - Click to expand for more detail.
  - Provide feedback via üëç/üëé to refine model accuracy.
- **Target Schema Metadata**: Enriched descriptions pulled from sources such as GDC.
