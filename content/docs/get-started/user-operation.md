The Shortcut Panel provides quick-access buttons for managing match candidates. Located at the top-left corner of the BDIViz interface, it offers essential operations to streamline your workflow.

## Available Actions

| Button | Symbol | Function | Visual Effect |
|--------|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Accept** | ✓ | Confirms the selected source-to-target candidate as a valid match | Cell turns **green** |
| **Reject** | ✕ | Marks the selected match as invalid | Cell turns **red** |
| **Discard** | 🗑️ | Removes source attribute from consideration when no suitable match exists | Attribute appears **grayed out** |
| **Undo** | ⟲ | Reverts your most recent operation | Restores previous state |
| **Redo** | ⟳ | Reapplies the most recently undone action | Reapplies change |

> **Note:** All actions are logged in the Timeline Panel on the right, creating a complete audit trail of your decision-making process.
